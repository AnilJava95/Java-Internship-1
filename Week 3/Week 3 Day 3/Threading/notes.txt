When you launch the main page from two different browsers and withdraw 600 at the same time it will go to negative balance. 
   Because the both browsers immediately check(one after another) if there is enough balance to do this withdraw first
   and then wait 2 seconds and then withdraw the money. So the second withdraw test happens before first withdraw.

Also uses synchronized keyword to make cpu sequential. If you comment out the syncronized and its both braces,
it will be thread unsafe again.
